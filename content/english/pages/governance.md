## 1. Name of the table

The Québec Environmental DNA Table (TAQ), hereinafter referred to as "the TAQ", acts both as a facilitator ensuring communication between the various economic actors surrounding environmental DNA (eDNA) technology, and as a think tank on various aspects related to the use of eDNA in Québec, notably the deployment of technologies, access to reliable resources, and data governance.

## 2. Academic affiliation

Since its founding, the TAQ has been under the responsibility of INRS. However, the managing institution may change following a decision by the TAQ's leadership team or when a grant is awarded to ensure its sustainability. The person in charge of the group is not necessarily affiliated with the managing institution.

## 3. Mission and objectives

The TAQ’s mission is to inform, assist, and serve as a resource for government bodies (federal, provincial, and municipal), the Canadian population, non-profit organizations (NPOs), and the industry regarding eDNA technology. The TAQ website hosts a user guide and a list of laboratory services available in Québec and nearby regions to meet the growing demand for eDNA-related services (www.TAQ.info).

The objectives of the TAQ include:

- **3.1** Democratize access to eDNA by ensuring knowledge sharing between scientists and government organizations, First Nations, Inuit, the private sector, NPOs, the general public, and all other end users;
- **3.2** Assist eDNA users by guiding them to the most up-to-date methodological resources and available services in Québec;
- **3.3** Strengthen partnerships, pool efforts and resources, and maximize the use of Québec’s facilities and equipment;
- **3.4** Integrate and strengthen innovative and multidisciplinary eDNA research in Québec and Canada, as well as internationally, by increasing collaboration and interaction.

## 4. Membership

The TAQ includes the following categories of members:

- **4.1 Service Providers**  
  A service provider offers one or more services directly or indirectly related to eDNA technology. Services may include (but are not limited to): sampling, laboratory analysis, data analysis, data interpretation, data storage, and training. A member may be both a service provider and a service user.

- **4.2 Service Users**  
  A service user seeks access to one or more services related to eDNA technology. Services may include (but are not limited to): sampling, laboratory analysis, data analysis, data interpretation, data storage, and training. A member may be both a service provider and a service user.

- **4.3 Partner Organizations**  
  An organization interested in eDNA technology and wishing to stay informed of developments. Organizations seeking partnership must submit their logo and agree to share the TAQ’s logo on their website.

## 5. Leadership and management of taq activities

TAQ governance is based on a results-oriented governance model. This model may be modified by the decision of the steering committee or as required by a grant process.

### 5.1 Definition of Leadership Roles

The **Director** is identified as the person responsible for the TAQ. The term is three years. In case of resignation, the Co-Director assumes the responsibilities for the remainder of the term. It is recommended that the terms of the Director and Co-Director do not end in the same year to ensure continuity. If the Co-Director is not willing to take over, the Director may serve a second term of three years. A maximum of three terms is allowed.

The **Co-Director** supports the Director in their responsibilities. The term is three years. If the Co-Director resigns or becomes the acting Director, an interim Co-Director is appointed by the steering committee. Ideally, the Co-Director becomes the Director at the end of their term to ensure continuity.

The **Leadership Team** (Director and Co-Director) shares management and leadership responsibilities. Their primary role is to inspire members and ensure a positive and sound management of the TAQ. At the end of their terms, a call for nominations is launched and the team ensures a smooth transition.

The **Coordinator** reports directly to the leadership team and oversees the coordination of the TAQ and its activities.

### 5.2 Definition of Committees

The **Steering Committee** is responsible for strategically planning TAQ activities and evaluating achievements. It includes the leadership team, the Coordinator, and 8–10 service providers and users representing a broad range of economic sectors within the TAQ.

An **External Advisory Committee** provides annual guidance to the scientific committee. It is composed of two representatives from Canadian federal ministries and three international experts, as well as members of the TAQ leadership and coordination teams.

## 6. Membership procedure

Any individual or organization interested in joining the TAQ must complete the membership form available on the TAQ website (www.TAQ.info).

## 7. Approval and amendments to the statutes

The Steering Committee may approve these statutes on its own initiative. Any TAQ member may propose amendments, which must be approved by the Steering Committee.
