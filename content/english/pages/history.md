The Québec Environmental DNA Table (TAQ) was established in 2025 in response to a growing need for coordination and knowledge sharing around environmental DNA (eDNA) in Québec. This technology is recognized for its potential for biodiversity monitoring such as the detection keystone species, cryptic animals, and invasive taxa in natural and managed ecosystems.

The TAQ was designed as a multisectoral forum, bringing together experts, practitioners, government agencies, Indigenous communities, municipalities, non-profit organizations, and businesses. Its mission: to facilitate collaboration, improve access to reliable resources, and support the development of tools, standards, and services related to eDNA.

The TAQ is built on a collaborative governance model, with a leadership team from academic, government, private and NGO sectors, supported by an external committee of national and international experts. At this early stage, the TAQ has a flexible structure that allows its organizational base to evolve through partnerships and funding.

Today, the TAQ plays a key role in the eDNA ecosystem in Québec by providing:
  - A website showcasing available services (sampling, analysis, data processing),
  - Educational and technical resources,
  - A directory of active members by sector and region,
  - A series of events for dialogue to advance best practices, standardization, and data governance in eDNA.
